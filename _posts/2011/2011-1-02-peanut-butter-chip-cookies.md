This was a recipe that I found based on the ingredients that I happened to buy at Trader Joe’s. I chose to add chocolate and white chocolate chips to yield a more interesting outcome!

**Ingredients**

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda (I used powder)
- 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup packed light-brown sugar (I used Trader Joe’s cane sugar)
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 cup smooth peanut butter (I used JIF single serving packets I bought a while back and never used – and I used about 1 oz over 1 cup)
- chocolate and white chips, to your liking
- sugar for embellishing

** Directions**

**1.** Prepare ingredients

**2.** Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a baking sheet (I used a baking mat).

**3.** Sift together flour, salt and baking soda, and set aside. Bonus points for pink mixing bowls!

**4.** In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy.

**8. **Add chocolate chips to your liking. The goal is to maximize chips without making the dough unworkable.

**9.** Form each cookie into a ball using about a tablespoon of dough. Place cookies on the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart.

**10.** Press fork slightly into the cookies to make the signature crosshatched top. Squiisshhhh…

**12.** Bake until golden, about 10-15 minutes. I would put them in for ten, and then check and adjust from there based on your cookie texture preference.
