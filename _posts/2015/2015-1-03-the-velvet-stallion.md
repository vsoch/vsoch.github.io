Tangled and fiery, you know his kind  
 Intensity and anguish burns his mind  
 Darkly focused, inexorably lucid  
 Barraging loves, timidly elusive  
 The velvet stallion, charging by day  
 Barraging loves, barrier you away.

A swirling of desire caught in his eye  
 Witty and fickle, but secretly shy  
 A single glance, you enveloped inside  
 A yearning of intense unforgiving stride  
 He dances the mountains, hoping for you  
 He clenches the wind, to hear what to do

A parcel of dream new in his soul  
 Painful and tickle, confusing his goal  
 His passion is nausea, uneasy at best  
 His lucid dream, presenting without rest  
 The unrelenting yearning that brings a scar  
 The trickling wanting, to know where you are

Atop of the world, heart racing with pain  
 The landscape he dominates, whispering a claim  
 It is not lust, sexual, or cognitively clear  
 why he shall never be rested without you near  
 Tamed he will not be, to pause in his stride  
 but to fit into your space, he shall abide.

Tentative and cautious, proceed in your course  
 to have captured the spirit of this velveteen horse  
 His moment of clarity, in the quiet of his mind  
 he is infinitely connected to you, your subtle sign  
 A passion so wired, twisty, and deep  
 in his heart forever, you he will keep.
