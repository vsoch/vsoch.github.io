Fifteen years you would would think <br>
Is enough to subside the pain <br>
Fifteen years you would think <br>
Is enough for the heart to heal. <br>
But the hole was not filled, and the heart remembers <br>
The memory is not gone, through all these Decembers. <br><br>

There are certain songs that he hears <br>
That tear him apart inside <br>
There are certain times that he fears <br>
That his younger hopes and dreams were a lie. <br><br>

He thought he might fall in love again <br>
But the feeling was nevermore. <br>
Can he just be grateful to have found a best friend, <br>
And a deeper companionship than before? <br><br>

Maybe that’s something greater <br>
That he is truly cared for. <br>
Maybe that is something greater  <br>
that he is much better matched than before. <br><br>

He goes through day after day <br>
Pointing out joy and meaning <br> 
As if his mind is to say <br>
That he should not be grieving. <br><br>

And he realizes it is possible to have a joyful life <br>
Even if he has loved and lost. <br>
It is possible to put on a strong face <br>
At whatever time and cost. <br><br>

But that's just what it is, <br> 
a constant distraction from the ache <br>
An effort to just pass the time, <br>
With whatever he can make <br><br>

And maybe we are just complex <br>
And impressionable for a short time. <br>
Maybe these powerful effects. <br>
Happen on a very short line. <br><br>

He used to listen to this song <br>
That he would find you somehow <br>
But perhaps it was just his long <br> 
To find himself by now. <br><br>

It was cruel what you did, <br>
To take his heart and make it fly <br>
And then cut away sharply <br>
Leaving him alone to cry. <br><br>

So he lies there at night. <br>
Unable to sleep in his bed. <br>
He dreams sometimes of you and awakes in fright <br>
And writes down senseless thoughts from his head. <br><br>

Maybe love is not meant for us all <br>
Or maybe finding your best friend is much more <br>
Maybe he has yet to hear it’s call <br>
Or maybe he is better off than before. <br><br>

Have others that he sees really found the one? <br>
Or do not know the world like he knew? <br>
Does every rise and fall of the sun, <br>
Give them these emotions from bright to dark blue? <br><br>

He can't say he knows what is his purpose <br>
But he fills the time to nourish his soul <br>
This crazy life that is a circus  <br>
Where progress is just another goal. <br><br>

What surprises might the future hold? <br>
Do we ever escape from our routine? <br>
What about all that we were told, <br>
Will he only remember love in his dreams? <br><br>

He loves to have the deepest of sleep <br>
Because sometimes you are there <br>
His dreams, so vivid and deep <br>
So free and without a care.<br><br>

But maybe it is not you that he misses <br>
But that feeling of his heart racing <br>
The desire for a lovers kiss <br>
A fantasy that we are all chasing. <br><br>

He suspects another fifteen years will go by, <br>
And he will still wonder what he did wrong <br>
Another twenty will go by, <br>
And aching will be his hearts permanent song. <br><br>

He didn’t ask to love you forever <br>
He didn’t ask for this pain <br>
He wishes you never made it your endeavor <br>
To find out his name <br><br>

Why did you love and leave him? <br>
Weeping alone in his hospital bed <br>
Why did you open his eyes to see <br>
And then take back what you said? <br><br>

When it all becomes too much <br>
He focuses on being grateful for what he has <br>
When there are things to do <br>
There is little time to be sad. <br><br>

He is so lucky for that <br>
Because to be cared for is a lot <br>
He is lucky to be loved <br>
And hugged when he feels naught. <br><br>

And when he cannot sleep he tries to unclench his fist <br>
And imagine living on a whim <br>
He goes through the mental list <br>
Of what a good life means to him <br><br>

Is it selfish to just want one more time <br>
That experience of falling in love? <br>
Is it selfish to want to utter that line, <br>
And feel ones heart strings tug? <br><br>

It will have to be enough <br>
To not have any of those expected things <br>
Soft candlelight romance <br>
White dress and wedding rings <br><br>

He can’t stop writing down words <br>
They pour out of him like silenced tears <br>
He can’t stop thinking these words. <br>
They continue to build up in him for years. <br><br>

He wishes he knew how to let it go <br>
To not find himself in these moments of pain <br>
He wish that he could know <br>
What experiences would help to tame. <br><br>

A deep breathe in <br>
And then out in rhyme <br>
A second breath in <br>
One more time. <br><br>

To fill this hole <br>
And replace it with something greater <br>
That might be his only goal <br>
For now and forever later<br><br>

So here he is, again at 4am <br>
Pouring out his soul in rhyme. <br>
Realizing that he will probably forever mourn <br>
That beautiful, but so short a time.<br><br>

Knowing that you have fallen in love with someone else,  <br>
And it was not a we. <br>
Knowing that time has woven and left these welts <br>
And it could never be. <br><br>
