I am Van. I am Van. Van-I-Am! <br>

Do you like clusters and Pam? <br>

I do not like them, Van-I-Am. <br>
I do not like clusters and Pam. <br>
I do not want to shell into a cluster. <br>
I do not want to use luste. <br>
I do not want them for my compute. <br>
I do not want them its done and moot! <br>

Do you like bash? <br>

I do not like bash, <br>
I feel like it's always about to crash. <br>
I don't want to deal with an escape or slash <br>
I do not want to create a hash, <br>
or store a container in a cache, <br>
And in fact I want to put it in the trash. <br>

Would you like them in the cloud? <br>

I would not like them in the cloud, <br>
no matter how snazzy or how loud. <br>
I am not monetarily endowed, <br>
nor do I want to render my finances plowed. <br>
No matter how you if'd and'd, or how'd, <br>
Your permissions error says I'm not allowed. <br>

Would you like them with AI? <br>

I would not like them with AI. <br>
I do not think they need to learn to lie. <br>
I would not like them with a brain, <br>
I would not like them to fly a plane, <br>
I do not want them to push to main. <br>
It is too much of a drain, <br>
and a bit more of a pain. <br>

What about machine learning? <br>

I do not want my machines to learn <br>
or the buzzword bullshit to twist and turn <br>
I do not have the yearning, <br>
to feel my computer burning <br>
Or have a conversation with someone about "ML" <br>
Because really it's something you are trying to sell <br>
and frankly I'd rather go to hell. <br>

Would you like them on a Mac? <br>

I would not like them on a Mac. <br>
I believe in honoring the headphone jack. <br>
I don't care about your new M1 <br>
Because nothing on it can be done. <br>
The only thing that really wants to run <br>
is my patience, which is headed for the sun. <br>

Would you like them in an app? <br>

I would not like them in an app. <br>
I don't want to install with snap. <br>
Or try your new packaged crap. <br>
Or fall into your nodejs Electron trap. <br>
Please add my crushing cynicism to your mental map. <br>
Because any kind of effort will simply flap. <br>

Would you like them with a bro? <br>

I would not like them with a bro. <br>
Just as much as I'd like to sit naked in the snow. <br>
I do not want him to preach me the laurels of tensorflow, <br>
or how whatever I'm doing is just too slow. <br>
Living in Silicon Valley does not make you know. <br>
But it might leave you in quite a low. <br>
Ruminating about all the lower cost places you could go! <br>

Would you like them here and now? <br>
Would you like them with a cow? <br>

I do not want them here and now. <br>
Or in the future or with a cow. <br>
If a cow learns to compute I'll be out of work <br>
and writing hateful posts about that dairy jerk <br>
But cheese is delicious who am I kidding? <br>
It's us who should do the cow's bidding. <br>

Would you like them with a display? <br>
Would you like them in the month of May? <br>

I do not like them in the cloud. <br>
I do not like them endowed. <br>
I do not like them with AI. <br>
I do not like them however sky high. <br>
I do not like them on a Mac. <br>
I do not like them with a snack. <br>
I do not like them on an app. <br>
I do not like them on a map. <br>
I do not like them with a bro. <br>
I do not like them in the snow. <br>
I do not want them here and now, <br>
I do not want them with a cow. <br>
I do not like clusters and Pam. <br>
I do not like them, Van-I-Am. <br>

Would you ssh from in a box? <br>
Would you ssh while wearing socks? <br>

Not in a box. Not wearing socks. <br>
Not with a display. Not in the month of May. <br>
I do not want them here and now, <br>
I do not want them with a cow. <br>
I do not like clusters and Pam. <br>
I do not like them, Van-I-Am. <br>

Would you? Could you? On a train? <br>

I would not, could not, on a train. <br>
Nor would I consider on a plane. <br>
And don't ask me about in a car; <br>
I'd sooner drink myself silly at a bar. <br>
I do not want to waste my time, <br>
or edit documents with Sublime. <br>
Why do you pester me? <br>
Why can you not let me be? <br>

Please, just try them once, from your car! <br>
Shell in! Shell in! Here they are. <br>

I do not like them in the cloud. <br>
I do not like them soft or loud. <br>
I do not like them with AI. <br>
I do not like them with pie. <br>
I do not like them on a Mac. <br>
You're going to give me heart attack! <br>
I do not like them on an app.  <br>
I do not like them with a frappe. <br>
A do not like them with a bro. <br>
I do not like them if they glow. <br>
I do not want them here and now, <br>
I do not want them with a sow. <br>
I do not want them in a box. <br>
I would not, could not, on a train. <br>
I would not, could not, on a plane. <br>
Can you see you are driving me insane? <br>
Not from my car! Not from a bar! <br>
I do not like clusters and Pam! <br>
I do not like them, Van-I-Am! <br>

You do not like them. So you say. <br>
Try them! Try them! And you may. <br>
Try them and you may, I don't play. <br>

Van! If you let me be, <br>
I will try them. You will see. <br>

(... ssh ...) <br>

Yes it is confirmed! I do not like clusters and Pam! <br>
I do not! I do not like them, Van-I-Am! <br>

It is so bad, so bad, you see! <br>
I'd rather go off and live in a tree. <br>
A box sounds nice to avoid this screen. <br>
Or a void of endless screams.  <br>

Say! I will despise them anywhere! <br>
I do so despise clusters and Pam! <br>
Thank you! Thank you, Van-I-Am. <br>
