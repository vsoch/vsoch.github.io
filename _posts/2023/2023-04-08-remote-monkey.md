As an avid World of Warcraft player in my younger years, I've loved the
code monkey video since the first time I saw it.

For those that aren't familiar, it depicts a big, aggressive looking "code monkey" (that
we assume to be a programmer in an office job) that is secretly pining over a dark
elf (another species in World of Warcraft) that works in his office. It's a touch of the hat
funny that it takes place in "Booty Bay" 
<a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stranglethorn_Vale" target="_blank">in Stranglethorn Vale</a>, one of the easier
zones to level in as a new player. It's rather silly, but the underlying message is that
even someone like code monkey has a "warm fuzzy secret heart." This shouldn't be surprising,
but it is only an issue in our present society where men (and code monkeys, generally) are
discouraged from being anything but big and strong. Even a code monkey
has a need to express and be loved.

A little over a decade ago there was a contest for a Google TV (yes, I do think
there was such a thing!) and I decided to enter by making a video parody of this
song that would explain why I definitely needed one. Side note - I really didn't
have much need for a TV, but I jumped on the creative endeavor, and I told a similar
story of having an empty apartment that would be improved by such an asset, and
of course following the code monkey trend, someone to love. Enough years have passed that I find 
this video slightly embarrassing. For example, you can see I'm using Windows! 
The computer lab in the video is where I used to run ~3 hour behavioral assessments for my lab, 
and I would spend a lot of time in there alone, and yes, dance quite a bit. You
can even see the board to the left of my head that has advertisements for other studies
for the students to take. You can also tell that I'm always slightly sleep deprived - I used
to wake up before 5am to run and get ready, and then spend an entire day working.
To be frank, I didn't take care of myself. It was my first job after college (not my
first by far) but the first time I was renting an apartment and fully independent and 
paying the bills, and I was determined to be successful, no matter what. This meant that I erred on the
side of not taking care of myself, in any dimension really. With a tight schedule
of running people at the MRI machine, doing 3 hour behavioral batteries, making
time to do programming for the lab, spending time in the lab to help the graduate students, and running 
or exercise or errands, my life was controlled by the clock. That is best reflected by the beginning
portion of showing the alarm clock. I don't even own an alarm clock anymore, and I
set an alarm maybe a few times a year. 

As a final side note, I'm also amazed at the 
amount of apartment that a $525 monthly rent could get you
on the East Coast over a decade ago. That red coat hanging in my apartment (that I've
had since high school) is also still my main winter jacket. Here is a picture from
last winter!

Yes, that means it's over two decades old! It's a great jacket! I think I got it at that
store that was called EMS(?), which I'm not sure exists anymore because I hardly ever go
shopping for things. But I digress! If you are interested,

## New Challenges During the Pandemic

> The pandemic is not just about disease, but rather loneliness.

I stumbled on the Code Monkey video again earlier this week, and just as before, loved it immensely.
However, it got me thinking - how has the reality for the code monkeys (myself included)
changed in the last decade? In the last three years because of the pandemic?
I've been watching a YouTube channel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@aaronsjournal139">Aaron's Channel</a>
where a 40 something man with autism decided to speak openly about his struggles with loneliness.
Dear reader, his words hit me straight in the heart, and had me realize that (especially
in the pandemic) there is a (possibly larger?) epidemic of loneliness. However, because
we are expected to behave in certain ways, it's not appropriate to share this
with colleagues, or even family. Aaron makes some good points - that most people by late 30s or
early 40s have started their own families, so (on top of the pandemic) it's not clear how to make
friends or meet potential romantic partners. By way of this channel having
over 15K subscribers (at the time of this writing) I know the message and desire for
companionship is something many people can relate to. It makes me wonder who around me
might be struggling, and hiding it. It makes me despondent that our society has not
done a good job of taking care of its members' mental health. 
That keeps me awake at night, because I think about the people close to me, and wish I could help. 

## Code Monkey is now Remote Monkey

I largely understand that I would never be able to give a hug to all the lonely
people in the world. For most of them, we will never know it. So I channeled my
empathy into a creative endeavour, and one that would allow me to express my own
experience as a remote monkey, which is a dichotomy of thriving in the things
that give me joy, and still sometimes struggling with that same "bigger picture" loneliness.
In this endeavour I also wanted to show a real person. I'm hugely turned off by
influencer culture, where girls and women are expected to be clad in makeup,
and then they add on filters that make them look like cartooon characters. Many women
even (without realizing it) do these little poses with their arms and legs in pictures.
In this video I wanted to really roll out of bed, tie up my hair, and put on some
cherry chapstick. I wanted to capture a more genuine depiction of "a day in the life"
when you live in about ~620 square feet and work on a computer. For men and women
alike, I believe that part of accepting ourselves as we get older is not hiding 
our actual selves. Having loved someone (even from afar) a handful of times in my life, 
I can tell you that the other person was never perfect, or even someone that others might consider attractive.
So (my advice) that might not be for everyone is just embrace being you. Without
further adieu:

It wouldn't embed as I wanted, so please follow the link. And there are actually two parts to this video! It starts with a light-hearted 
rendition of Jonathan Coulton's "Code Monkey" modified to be about a "Remote Monkey" where I poke fun at the regular 
routine of waking up, programming all day, and leaving some small time for exercise and play. 
It's not exactly singing - it's speaking deeply, and I can't do justice to mimic 
Jonathan Coulton's rich voice and backup music, but I did my best for a quick late evening effort! 
A subtle message in this piece is that despite our routine, we have moments of feeling trapped by
the pandemic, and we hope and dream for more than that. The use of the color
blue in term and visual is intentional and highlights the presence of this
sadness.

Halfway through, you hear a DJ cut, and a voice coming in that has issue
with the first depiction of the life of a remote monkey. For the second part,
I wanted to send the message that we have to choose to thrive despite it all.
Despite it all, there is curiosity and beauty in the world, and it's up to
us to seek the challenge and experience that will give our life meaning.
Sure, at the end of the day we will find ourselves back in our beds, ready to 
wake up again. But somehow, we squeezed that day maximally of its experience.
We lived as much as we could, sharing joy and strength with others, and the
rare quality to be able to be a light in the darkness is what draws others
to us.

```

If you too are a remote monkey, I hope that you recognize having moments of
sadness or reflection is OK, and to embrace them, and to find points of focus
that, even if a distraction, allow you to finish a day with a sense of satisfaction
and fulfillment. Tomorrow will be another challenge, but at least today, you got it.
