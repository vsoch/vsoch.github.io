There's a tiny hurt <br>
That lives in my heart <br>
and never do I let him out <br>
Because of the trouble that he might start <br><br>

But that tiny hurt <br>
he emerges once or twice a year <br>
sometimes it is random <br>
or some days that I know to fear <br><br>

He expands outward filling my chest <br>
with a feeling of pain, <br>
a feeling of sorrow, <br>
A feeling of unrest <br><br>

Because that pain, is the absence of you <br>
That pain is me remembering your joy <br>
and now not knowing  <br>
what to do <br><br>

It is seeing your face <br>
that I never knew <br>
It is feeling your grace <br>
that gave me life anew <br><br>

When I hear your voice <br>
I am filled with life <br>
I can overcome any choice <br>
I can conquer any strife <br><br>

But then in the pause <br>
of the evening light <br>
I am a rebel without cause <br>
A fighter without might <br><br>

I know I'll miss you forever <br>
But me? I am split in two. <br>
Perhaps my greatest endeavor <br>
has been bravely loving you. <br><br>

There is a tiny hurt <br>
That lives in my heart <br>
I wish I could evict him <br>
But then we'd be worlds apart. <br><br>
