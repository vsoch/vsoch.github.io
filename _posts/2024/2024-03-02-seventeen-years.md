Sometimes when we look for self <br>
Or hope our eyes take in the light <br>
We search for meaning on an empty shelf. <br>
And wake up in the cold, black night. <br>

When our soul is stumbling and lost <br>
We try to survive, day by day, <br>
But we find there is too much cost <br>
To the understanding to make it OK. <br>

We imagine a warmth to hold <br>
And for a peaceful sleep. <br>
But the hospital is cold. <br>
And our dreams are not ours to keep. <br>

The rules of the world are shattered <br>
They no longer apply to you. <br>
All the things you thought had mattered. <br>
Are strangely gone and defined anew. <br>

When we look and do not find. <br>
When we hope and do not see. <br>
What is left is strength of mind. <br>
We still have what might come to be. <br>

Seventeen years <br>
Have come to pass <br>
More than half a lifetime, <br>
Of strength amassed. <br>

But resilience and strength <br>
Does not come from external source <br>
It eminates deeply <br>
As life endures its course <br>

Once, thrice, six times stuck down. <br>
The monsters that I fought <br>
Were not the physical pains <br>
But the monster in my head. <br>
That I had to feign. <br>
