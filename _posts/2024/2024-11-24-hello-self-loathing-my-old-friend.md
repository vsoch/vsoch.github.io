Hello self-loathing, my old friend <br>
You've come to torture me again <br>
While my self-esteem is leaping, <br>
You show up forceful, inward creeping. <br>
Because the joy, that was dancing in my brain. <br>
You try to claim <br>
You give me hell, defiance! <br>

In restless angst, I've been alone <br>
Through the wildness I'll roam <br>
In the darkness of a tunnel <br>
My spinning mind an endless puzzle. <br>
I'm blinded another passing light <br>
Filled with night <br>
I need a hug, and guidance <br>

And in my mind's eye I did see <br>
The problem's almost always me. <br>
Not good enough or worth keeping <br>
Not smart enough, attention seeking. <br>
People doing wrongs -- they really never cared. <br>
You're impaired. <br>
Safety is self reliance. <br>

"Folks" said I, "You do not know <br>
This burden of internal blow. <br>
See my wrongs they might teach you <br>
Don't repeat them I beseech you. <br>
My self-worth, like diving eagles fell <br>
No one tell <br>
Choose not love but violence. <br>

And my folks they are dismayed. <br>
At this monster that they made. <br>
But tomorrow is a new morning. <br>
When new hopes they might be forming. <br>
And the beauty of the world is written in our falls" <br>
Our tunnel walls. <br>
And I found peace in silence. <br>
