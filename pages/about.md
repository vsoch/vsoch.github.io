<p style="padding-top:40px;">I am a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsochat/" target="_blank">Computer Scientist</a> at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/" target="_blank">Lawrence Livermore National Lab</a> and an active dinosaur in the open source community. 
I specialize in system engineering, infrastructure development, and automation for computational analyses and workflows.
I have recently joined the Flux Framework project, where I am lead developer for the Flux Operator (for Kubernetes) and working on extending various language bindings. I have vision for extending the lab's coolest open source projects into more broad cloud-native communities,
 and for improving the developer experience. Previously I was a research software engineer at Stanford University in the
<a href="https://srcc.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Research Computing Center</a>, and was lead developer for
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188511" target="_blank">Singularity Hub</a>, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/work">more open source projects</a> than I can count.
I also founded and ran <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/research-software-engineering-services" target="_blank">RSE Services</a> (Research Software Engineering Services), 
created the first <a href="https://stanford-rc.github.io/stanford-software-survey/" target="_blank">Stanford Software Survey</a>, 
and was responsible for submitting the first proposal to make Research Software Engineer an official role at Stanford. In 2019 I created the (now) <a href="https://rseng.github.io/devstories" target="_blank">Developer Stories</a> podcast, and continue to host and produce it to present day.</p>

<p>As a graduate student my work spanned computer science, medicine, and imaging. I was a proud member of the <a href="https://poldracklab.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Poldrack Lab</a> at Stanford. Our work spanned neuro-informatics, cognitive neuroscience, and reproducibility. I was introduced to the domain of neuroimaging as an RA in the <a href="http://www.haririlab.com" target="_blank">Laboratory of Neurogenetics</a> at Duke University working under Ahmad Hariri.</p>

<p style="line-height:26px">The qualities of experience that are most fulfilling to me are making things work, organizing and understanding new processes, and creating efficiency and beauty in design. I love learning, programming and debugging, and I have vision for how I want the future to be. I am adamant about pursuing the things that make me happy, today and now. A successful life means confidence in a future vision and happiness in the present.</p>

<p>While this is primarily a personal site, most of my life can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/vsoch" target="_blank">[github]</a>, and a general list of work under <a href="/work">[portfolio]</a>. If my open source work has been useful to you, or you want to better support the ecosystem, please consider <a href="https://github.com/users/vsoch/sponsorship" target="_blank">sponsoring</a> this dinosaur!
